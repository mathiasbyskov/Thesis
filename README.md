# Thesis

This repository holds the files and scripts related to my Master's Thesis. A 30 ECTS project done at the Bioinformatics Research Center at Aarhus University.

## Project Description

**Title:**      
Predicting Protein Secondary Structure using Artificial Neural Networks with a focus on RNNs

## Description of scripts:

1. data_inspection: Script used to produce all the information and characteristics of the CB513 dataset (chapter 4).
2. onelayer_nn: Script that holds all functions and classes related to the FFNN one_layer implementation.
3. rnn: Script that holds all functions and classes related to the RNN/LSTM/GRU implementation.
4. results_*: Scripts used to create the results in the assignment (uses the main-function from onelayer_nn and rnn). Results are presented in chapter 5 + 6.
5. utils: Script that holds all the functions necessary in both onelayer_nn and rnn. Mainly data-specific functions.
